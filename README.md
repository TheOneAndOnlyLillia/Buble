Buble is a website that tells the struggles and successes of many popular businesses, this was inspired by a dvd channel that my parents would play us in the car during long drives, called How I Did it. I really enjoyed listening to the different stories of people who started their businesses from humble beginnings and wished the DVD was more popular. I wanted to make a shorter version of it and a social media sort of version, still in the process, to make it more accessible and easier to find for others. This is my first HTML and CSS project ever and I went through a lot of ups and downs but am happy with the result so far. I didn't know much HTML of CSS when I started this so I mostly used video tutorials to learn hwo to build the skeleton of the website, and after a ton of deleting code and rewriting it to make it work, I was abel to make it functionable and really began to enjoy the project and make it look cute.
